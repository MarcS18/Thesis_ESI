The filtrate was concentrated and the residue was purified by flash chromatography over silica using a hexane/ethyl acetate eluant to afford ethyl 4-fluoro-l-(5-(4-fluorophenoxy)pyrazin-2-yl)piperidine-4- carboxylate as a yellow oil (0.120 g, 28percent). To a stirred solution of this intermediate (0.120 g, 0.330 mmol) in 1 : 1 (v/v) methanol/water (4 mL) was added solid sodium hydroxide (0.066 g, 1.65 mmol). After overnight stirring, the reaction was concentrated. The residue was dissolved in water, made acidic (pH ~3) with the addition of IN hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried (Na2S04) and concentrated to afford 4-fluoro-l-(5-(4- fluorophenoxy)pyrazin-2-yl)piperidine-4-carboxylic acid as a white solid (0.090 g, 81percent).

The reaction is performed in a 500-ml 3-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser topped with a nitrogen inlet tube and a stopper. The flask is charged with methanol (100 ml) and sodium (10.0 g, 0.43 mole). After all of the sodium has been consumed, the methanol is distilled from the flask, and the last traces are removed by azeotropic distillation with benzene. Pyridine (250 ml) and resorcinol (35.0 g, 0.32 mole) are added to the reaction mixture, followed by 3-bromobenzotrifluoride (50.0 g, 0.22 mole) and cuprous chloride (20 g, 0.20 mole), and the mixture is left to stir at reflux for 24 hours.  Capillary gas chromatograph (GC) analysis shows that approximately 87 percent of the mixture is the desired monoalkylation product, the rest being dialkylation product. The mixture is cooled and filtered with the aid of an organic solvent such as ether (200 ml). The ethereal phase is washed successively with water (250 ml), 5 percent HCl (2*500 ml), saturated NaHCO3 (200 ml), and brine (200 ml). It is then dried with MgSO4 and the solvents are removed on the rotary evaporator to leave 38.0 g of a dark oily residue. Purification is accomplished by fractional distillation in vacuo. The second fraction (distilling at 132° C. at 1.5 mm) consists of pure monoalkylation product (colorless oil, 25.20 g, 44.6 percent yield). The dialkylation product is not isolated. IR (neat film), 1 H-NMR (CDCl3), and 13 C-NMR (CDCl3) data show the structure to be 3-(3-trifluoromethylphenoxy)-phenol.

The residue was cooled, anhydrous pyridine (150 mL) was added, and the solution heated to reflux under N2. Dibromobenzene (50 g, 210 mmol) was then added, followed by CuCl (1.5 g), and the mixture was refluxed for 2 days.  After cooling, the reaction mixture was partitioned between H2 O (100 mL) and Et2 O (200 mL). The organic extract was acidified with conc. HCl in ice, and was further rinsed with 1N HCl (100 mL), H2 O (2*100 mL) and brine (100 mL). The organic extract was dried over Na2 SO4, and the solvent removed in vacuo.
