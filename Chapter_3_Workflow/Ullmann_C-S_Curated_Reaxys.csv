21,2-iodophenylamine,thiophenol,2-phenylsulfanyl-aniline,201.292,"Ligand 4a: A Schlenk flask was charged with CuCl (4.8mg, 0.048mmol), 2-iodoaniline (0.12mL, 1.05mmol), trans-1,2-diaminocyclo- hexane (0.26mL, 2.21mmol), water (6.3mL) and thiophenol (0.06mL, 0.57mmol). The flask was sealed under a positive pressure of argon and the resulting violet solution was heated overnight at 120°C. The product was extracted from the aqueous layer with dichloromethane, dried and concentrated in vacuo. The crude mixture was then purified by flash chromatography (10% CH2Cl2 in hexane) to give 2-(phenylthio)aniline 3 (102.1mg, 97%) as a colorless liquid. Then, the obtained 3 (1 eq) was added in the solution of 2a, and the resultant reaction mixture was stirred over 24hat room temperature.

The vial was evacuated and backfilled with argon. This was repeated twice. A solution of 133 μL N,N -dimethylethylenediamine (0.11 g, 1.2 mmol) in 5 mL of dioxane was injected into the vial. The vial was then capped and heated in a microwave oven at 130 °C for 1.5 hours. After cooling to room temperature, 123 mg of copper(I)iodide (0.65 mmol), 0.622 g of sodium iodide (4.15 mmol), 0.117 g of neocuproine (0.56 mmol), 0.944 g of 4-mercapto-benzoic acid methyl ester (5.61 πrmol) and 0.809 g of sodium tert-butoxide (8.41 mmol) were added to the above resulting mixture. The mixture was heated again using microwaves at 130 ° C for 4 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted with lithium hydroxide aqueous solution, prepared freshly from 0.62 g of lithium hydroxide (26 mmol) and 40 niL of water. The resulting mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature, extracted with 3 x 50 mL of dichloro methane. The aqueous layers were combined, and acidified with 4 M aqueous hydrochloride.
