This is the electronic supplementary information (ESI) associated with the Ph.D. thesis of Marc A.S. Short. The thesis title is "CatSD: Structural Database and High-Throughput Predictive Workflows for Homogeneous Catalyst Design". This ESI provides full details of the anlayses performed in the work, as well as access to the high-throughput workflow and scripts presented in the thesis. Using this we aim to provide better access to analysis reproducibility and make the workflow available for wider use.
